This repository serves the purpose of hosting the process of technical discussion and its archival.

## Requests for Discussion

[RFDs](https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0001) or RFC (Requests for Comment) is a common practice among technical folks to standardize a way
for proposing new features, changes, or improvements to a project. This repository is used to host the RFDs for ZINC. All evolutions of ZINC will be
discussed and documented in the form of RFDs.

> Please refer to the first RFD for more information on the process and how to contribute.

## Community Engagement

While the contents of this repository is mainly to facilitate and houses the result of the technical documents for ZINC,
we also welcome different kinds of engagement with us including feature proposal and bugs report.

Issues and Discussions are the main channels for community engagement. We encourage you to open an issue or start a discussion
if you have any questions, suggestions, or feedbacks. We will try our best to respond to you in a timely manner.

Generally, issues are for bugs report and feature requests, while discussions are for general questions and feedbacks.

> As of writing, we are still in the process of setting up the community engagement process. Please stay tuned for more updates.
